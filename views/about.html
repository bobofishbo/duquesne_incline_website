                        <p>The Duquesne Incline follows very closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Historical newspapers indicate the existence of such a conveyance as early as 1854, which residents referred to as "Kirk Lewis' incline" located on the present site of The Duquesne Incline's Upper Station.</p>
                        <p>During this period, Grandview Avenue was known as High Street, and the surrounding area was just beginning its transformation from farmland to residential properties. This pleasantly-situated acreage was perfect for absorbing Pittsburgh's expanding population, but the challenge of easy access remained unsolved.</p>
                        <p>Although plans for a freight and passenger incline existed much earlier, securing financial backing proved exceedingly difficult—even for the modest sum of $47,000—delaying actual construction. Eventually, these difficulties were overcome, and the Incline was built, opening to the public on May 20, 1877.</p>
                        <p>The Duquesne Incline was the first Pittsburgh incline designed and built by Samuel Diescher for Kirk Bigham and Associates. Diescher, an engineer, would become the country's foremost builder of inclines and went on to design and build most of those that followed.</p>

                        <p>At the time of its public opening, the Duquesne Incline was one of four inclined planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be known as Mount Washington. From 1877 until 1962, it was operated by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company.</p>
                        <p>Following a brief closure, local residents formed the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline in 1964. This neighborhood group had successfully rescued, repaired, and reopened the Incline in 1963, determined to preserve this vital piece of Pittsburgh's heritage.</p>
                        <p>Since 1964, the Society has continuously operated the Incline, while ownership transferred to the Port Authority of Allegheny County. Their mission remains focused on restoring and rehabilitating the cars, equipment, and both stations, while establishing the entire operation as both a reliable commuter facility and a popular visitor attraction.</p>
                        <p>Today, the Duquesne Incline stands as a testament to community preservation efforts and continues to serve as both a practical transportation method and a beloved tourist destination.</p>
